# 📅 Day 7 – SQL Mastery Journey

Today's focus is on understanding how to combine data from multiple tables using different types of JOINS.

## 🔍 Topics Covered
- INNER JOIN: Only matching rows
- LEFT JOIN / RIGHT JOIN: Keep all rows from one side
- FULL OUTER JOIN: All rows from both tables (using UNION)
- SELF JOIN: Join table to itself

## 📂 Files
- `01-inner-join.sql` → Match rows from both tables
- `02-left-right-join.sql` → Keep all rows from one table
- `03-full-outer-join.sql` → Simulate FULL JOIN using UNION
- `04-self-join.sql` → Compare within same table

## 💡 Tip
Use aliases (`e`, `d`, `A`, `B`) for clarity. Always test joins with NULLs to understand real-world behavior.
