# 📅 Day 8 – SQL Mastery Journey

Today focuses on SQL set operations and conditional logic for building smarter queries.

## 🔍 Topics Covered
- UNION vs UNION ALL
- INTERSECT simulation using INNER JOIN
- EXCEPT simulation using LEFT JOIN
- CASE WHEN for conditional transformations

## 📂 Files
- `01-union-intersect-except.sql` → Combine results using set logic
- `02-case-when.sql` → Apply conditional logic inside SELECT

## 💡 Tips
- Use UNION when you want unique results; UNION ALL when you want duplicates too.
- INTERSECT and EXCEPT are not available in MySQL; simulate them using JOINs and NULL checks.
- CASE is powerful for tagging, ranking, or categorizing data.
