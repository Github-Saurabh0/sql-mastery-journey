# 📅 Day 6 – SQL Mastery Journey

Today we dive into Subqueries – powerful SQL expressions that allow queries inside queries.

## 🔍 Topics Covered
- Scalar subqueries (returning single value)
- Table subqueries (returning multiple rows)
- Correlated subqueries (dependent inner queries)

## 📂 Files
- `01-scalar-subqueries.sql` → MAX(), AVG() based filters
- `02-table-subqueries.sql` → Subquery with IN clause
- `03-correlated-subqueries.sql` → Subquery using outer query reference

## 💡 Tip
✅ Use subqueries to replace joins where aggregation logic is simpler.  
⚠️ Use aliases (`e` in correlated queries) to avoid ambiguity.
