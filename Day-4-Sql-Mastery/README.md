Day 4 focuses on advanced filtering using the WHERE clause, logical operators, pattern matching, and limiting results.

## 🔍 Topics Covered
- WHERE conditions with AND, OR
- Pattern matching with LIKE
- Range filtering using BETWEEN, IN, NOT IN
- LIMIT and DISTINCT

## 📂 Files
- `01-where-conditions.sql` → Filtering with AND, OR
- `02-pattern-matching.sql` → Using LIKE with wildcards
- `03-range-filters.sql` → BETWEEN, IN, NOT IN
- `04-limit-distinct.sql` → Limit rows and get unique values

## 💡 Tip
Use `LIKE` when working with search fields. Always pair `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` for proper top/bottom records.
